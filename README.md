This is a mini project. It is a simple game of Rock-Paper-Scissors which we all played as kids.
Updates to the game will come.

## Rules:

- Paper beats Rock
- Scissors beat Paper

## Purpose of this project:
The purpose of this project is to practice my Git and GitHub skills. This game is known to all of us(and probably made
a lot of times) so it is not something special, just a mini project :). I will implement some unique features so the experience
will be more interesting.
